# Code Documentation for Vue.js Inventory Management App

This document provides an overview of the code for an inventory management web application built using Vue.js. The application allows users to manage containers and items within those containers.

## Project Structure

- **template.vue**: This is the Vue.js component that represents the user interface of the inventory management app. It includes a sidebar for managing containers and a section for managing items.

- **script.vue**: The script part of the component includes JavaScript logic that interacts with the Pinia store and handles user interactions.

- **src/store/index.js**: This is the Pinia store for managing the application's state, including containers, displayed items, and the selected container.

## Vue.js Component

### Sidebar

The sidebar in the Vue.js component is responsible for displaying a list of containers. Users can add, edit, and delete containers. It includes event handlers for these actions.

### Items

The "Items" section displays a list of items within the selected container. Users can add, edit, and delete items. Event handlers for these actions are also included.

## Setup Function

The `setup()` function within the Vue component handles the interaction between the component and the Pinia store. It sets up various methods and properties used in the template.

- `$store`: This variable connects the component to the Pinia store for state management.

- Methods: `editItemName`, `editContainer`, `deleteItem`, `deleteContainer`, `addItem`, `selectContainer`, and `addContainer` are all functions that allow users to perform CRUD operations on containers and items.

## Actions in Pinia Store

The Pinia store defines actions for managing the state of the application, such as fetching containers, adding containers, updating container names, selecting containers, adding items, deleting items, and more. These actions make API requests to interact with the server.

## Getters in Pinia Store

The store also includes a getter called `containersCount`, which provides the count of containers in the state.

  + script: String
}

class PiniaStore {

The class diagram illustrates the relationship between the Vue component and the Pinia store.

## PlantUML Sequence Diagram

```plantuml
@startuml
!define User <<User>>
!define VueComponent <<VueComponent>>
!define PiniaStore <<PiniaStore>>
!define API <<API>>

User -> VueComponent: Interact with UI
VueComponent -> PiniaStore: Access data and trigger actions
PiniaStore -> API: Make API requests
API --> PiniaStore: Respond with data
PiniaStore --> VueComponent: Update UI

The sequence diagram illustrates the interaction flow between the user, the Vue component, the Pinia store, and the API in the inventory management application.
